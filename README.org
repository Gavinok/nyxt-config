#+TITLE:My Nyxt Configuration Files

This is my repo with small tweaks to Nyxt that make it more
comfortable and personal. Things of interest here:

* Alternative format for status-buffer

I don't like the default wordy version of status-buffer (especially
with long mode names), so I define my own =short-format-status= to make
modeline a bit more minimalistic. Several helper functions
(=format-short-status-*=) are there to make things easier. 

This can evolve into an extension someday.

* Status-buffer tweaking for big screens

Small change in =status-buffer= CSS to make it more readable on a big
screen. It's commented for now, but I'll uncomment it once I fully
migrate to a big-screen PC.
